# CPEN 321 Git Exercise 

Please work in pairs to finish the following exercise. In the following, we refer to two of you as _Student A_ and _Student B_.

1. First, fork this repo.
2. In your forked repo, create a new branch `F1`.
3. Make two commits on `F1` branch: 
    
    _Commit 1_: 
      1. Add _Student A_ [student ID]+[name] as a new line to the file `CPEN321.txt`. For example 
     ```
     12345678+Jane Doe
     ```
      2. Commit with message `Student A`.
    
    _Commit 2_: 
      1. Similarly, add _Student B_ [student ID]+[name] as a new line to the file `CPEN321.txt`
      2. Commit with message `Student B`.
     
4. Squash commit 1 and 2 to `master` branch.
5. Submit a Pull Request titled `CPEN321` to the [original repo](https://github.com/dorawyy/CPEN321Git). The Pull Request should be from your forked repo `master` branch to the original repo `master` branch. 

__Note__: _If you feel uncomfortable sharing your personal information publicly, you can replace [student ID]+[name] with [project group ID]+[name], and send an email to Dr. Rubin after class. The TAs will then use your project group ID to identify you._
